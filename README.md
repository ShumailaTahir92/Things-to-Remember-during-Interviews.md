# Things-to-Remember-during-Interviews.md

## To start an interview on a positive and relaxed note, you can follow these steps:

1.Give a warm welcome and grin as you begin the interview. Make the candidate feel at ease and welcome right away.

2.Start up with a lighthearted icebreaker query or remark. For example, you may inquire about how they arrived at the interview place or compliment them on their achievements or résumé. This promotes a warm and welcoming environment.

3.Make it abundantly clear that this is a dialogue, not an interrogation, and that this is the goal of the interview. Express your want to learn more about the applicant, their background, and their viewpoints.

4.Briefly describe the format of the interview and what the candidate may anticipate. Let them know that there will be a chance for them to raise questions and that you respect their opinions. Any ambiguity or fear they might have is reduced as a result.

5.Engage in active listening at all times during the interview. Keep looking at them, nod when it's appropriate, and be genuinely interested in what they have to say. The applicant will feel heard and appreciated in this way.

6.Start off by asking open-ended questions that invite the applicant to express their opinions and experiences. They may express themselves more freely as a result, which promotes rapport.

7.When the candidate mentions something outstanding or impressive, give them praise and acknowledgement. They will feel more confident and valued as a result of this.

8.Make it clear that making errors or having doubts is OK and that the interview is a chance for both parties to learn more about one another. Make it clear that you are there to support the candidate and provide a welcoming atmosphere conducive to open dialogue.

Remember, the goal is to create a relaxed and positive atmosphere that encourages the candidate to feel comfortable and open up during the interview. By demonstrating genuine interest, active listening, and creating a supportive environment, you can help the candidate feel good and engaged from the beginning.
